# CSC207 Project
1) The problem domain that our team is working on is Finance, specifically, the long term growth of different stocks to see how they perforemd compared to others.
2) We would like to create an application that generates a visual tool such as a line graph of stock trends chosen by the user using data available from API calls, such that
   we can see long-term fluctuations in stock prices to make educated predictions on future stock market changes based on its history.
4) Documentation of the API we will use: https://polygon.io/docs/stocks/getting-started
5) Using GET command on the API to view information on AAPL stock using Postman:

7) Technical difficulties include :
   - Understanding how Postman works and all the different aspects of the Polygon API (There are a lot of filters and different tasks that you can make it do which can make it confusing, as well as many calls that are more complex then just a simple GET call.)
   - When trying to call the API, the following error shows up (likely an error on Polygon's end):
   - We also had issues with importing OkHTTP which we needed to call the API using Java.
